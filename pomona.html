<h1>ECON107: Applied Econometrics</h1>
In the first semester of my junior year (Fall 2014), I took Applied Econometrics with Professor Bowman Cutter. This class involved weekly applications with Stata where I dealt with datasets relevant for economic research. The following are datasets I am familiar with: Current Population Survey (CPS), National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY19), Equal Employment Opportunity Commission data (EEOC), and other data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). 

</p>
	<p> Below is an example of my code written for one of the Stata application assignments. This task required that I run monte carlo trials and transform the estimated betas using the matrix function.

<h1>Research Project 1: Measuring the value of “clutch” performance in the National Basketball Association</h1>

<p>For my Applied Econometrics class, I constructed and executed my own empirical research project. I’m very interested in labor economics, so I decided to look at decomposing wage differentials in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The question of what determines fair compensation in the NBA is particularly compelling because the impending increase in television revenue league wide will result in a growing salary cap, and analysis on remuneration on this changing market will help answer questions regarding the returns to performance under different situations. </p>

<p> I constructed my own theoretical model for observing clutch performance. This task required that I have a deep understanding of the salary structure in a very specific labor market and how differential worker productivity interacts with other measures of productivity. </p>

<p> I collected my own data and compiled it using a web scraping and web crawling script written in Python. I primarily worked with Python, Microsoft Excel, and Stata to compile, clean, and manipulate the relevant data. </p>



	<h1>Research Project 2: Counterfactual decomposition of the changes in the impact of teacher quality via Value-Added Models (VAM) using quantile regression</h1>
	<p>
My second independent research project, titled “Counterfactual decomposition of the changes in the impact of teacher quality via Value-Added Models (VAM) using quantile regression” is currently in its intermediate stages. I propose a method to decompose the impact of changes in teacher quality on student outcomes over a period of time through Value-Added Modeling (VAM). The method is based on the estimation of marginal changes in student test scores consistent with a conditional distribution estimated by quantile regression as well as with any hypothesized distribution for the covariates, particularly parent characteristics such as household income, retirement savings, and mother’s age at child’s birth. By comparing the marginal distributions of student test scores derived from the different distributions for parent characteristics, I can perform counterfactual exercises that may highlight concerns regarding the efficacy of VAM as it is used in contemporary education policy analysis. The proposed methodology enables the identification of the sources of changes in student outcomes as measured by test scores. It decomposes the changes in student test scores over a period of time into several factors that may contribute to those changes by distinguishing between changes in parent characteristics and changes in the returns to these characteristics. 
</p>
	<p>
The existing literature on VAM focuses on evaluating appropriate measures of teacher quality but fails to consider that the relationship between teacher quality and student outcomes may not be constant across the entire distribution. This paper attempts to address that possibility by utilizing the quantile regression method. Instead of focusing on associations at the mean, this method presents associations at specified quantiles of student outcomes. The VA estimates constructed by Chetty, Rockoff, and Friedman (2014a, 2014b) are predicted based on mean test scores. This paper will present VA estimates at specified quantiles of student outcomes.

</p>

<p>
This paper mirrors the strategy of Chetty, Rockoff, and Friedman (2014a, 2014b) by using the same data set. They draw information from two databases: administrative school district records and federal income tax records. The first dataset from administrative school district records includes test scores and teacher assignments in grades 3-8 from a large urban school district in the U.S. These data cover more than 2.5 million students and include over 18 million tests of math and English achievement spanning 1989-2009. Chetty, Rockoff, and Friedman (2014a, 2014b) match 90% of the observations in the school district data to selected data from United States tax records spanning 1996-2011. These data contain information on parent characteristics such as household income, retirement savings, and mother’s age at child’s birth. 

</p>
	<p>
This analysis will be interesting because it will provide more nuances to our understanding of the effectiveness of value-added modeling as it is currently used. This analysis could tell us whether teacher quality affects students differently depending on their preexisting skill level. Subsequently, the quantile regression method works synergistically with the analysis that examines the bias of VAM, specifically because it answers questions regarding the importance of accounting for student tracking (Kirabo 2014; Rothstein 2010; Koedel, Betts 2009). Furthermore, our construction of counterfactual exercises could tell us whether or not increases in teacher quality necessarily translates to improvements in student outcomes. 	</p>
