	<h1>Summer 2014 Research Assistantship</h1>
	<p>
I worked with Associate Dean of Research Fernando Lozano as a research assistant in Summer 2014. I worked exclusively on his project with the <a href="http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/index_html"> Institute for the Study of Labor </a>. This publication, titled <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp8950.pdf"> Rank-Order Tournaments, Probability of Winning and Investing in Talent: Evidence from Champions League Qualifying Rules </a>, uses time series data to exploit two different sources of variation that the UEFA rules generate: variation in the number of spots in each national league vary across time, and variation of where these spots fall in the qualification stages. 
</p>
	<p>
This paper analyzes how a change in the probability of winning a tournament affects an effort. In particular, we observed a soccer teamâ€™s behavior using the qualification rules for entry into the group and playoff stages of the UEFA Champions' League. Our results suggest that increasing the number of slots that a national league gets in the Champions' League leads to increases in investment in talent ex-ante. 	</p>
	<p>
As a research assistant, I was tasked with compiling, cleaning, and manipulating the data necessary for our empirical specifications. As payroll data is not publicly available we needed to use team valuation from transfermarkt.de for 12
leagues for the seasons 2006-2007, 2008-2009, 2010-2011 and 2013-2014. Furthermore, we needed to obtain the rankings for each country, qualifying teams and payoffs from participating in European competitions from the <a href="http://www.uefa.com/uefa/management/finance/index.html"> UEFA Financial Reports </a>. My approach in obtaining this data was to use python to write web scraping and web crawling scripts.
