	<h1>Summer 2014 Research Assistantship</h1>
	<p>
I worked with Associate Dean of Research Fernando Lozano as a research assistant in Summer 2014. I worked exclusively on his project with the <a href=“http://www.iza.org/en/webcontent/index_html”> Institute for the Study of Labor </a>. This publication, tiled <a href=“http://ftp.iza.org/dp8950.pdf”> Rank-Order Tournaments, Probability of Winning
and Investing in Talent: Evidence from Champions League Qualifying Rules </a> 	</p>
	<p>
This paper analyzes how a change in the probability of winning a tournament affects an effort. In particular, we observed a soccer team’s behavior using the qualification rules for entry into the group and playoff stages of the UEFA Champions' League. Our results suggest that increasing the number of slots that a national league gets in the Champions' League leads to increases in investment in talent ex-ante. 	</p>
